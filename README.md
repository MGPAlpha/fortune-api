# :crystal_ball: fortune-api :crystal_ball:

## Description
A RESTful API for the classic fortune command-line utility (in the fortune-mod package)
*Note: This API is still under construction*

## Adding Fortunes
To add a new fortune, go to the `datfiles` directory, and choose the correspoding file to contribute to.  If none of the files fit, feel free to make your own!  As with the original, fortunes deemed to be not-so-wholesome should be confined to the `datfiles/off` directory.

Simply type your fortune, formatted as you wish, and then follow it with a newline containing a `%`.  That's all!
